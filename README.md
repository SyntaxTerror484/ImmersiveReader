# ImmersiveReader

A simple tool to help copy notes efficiently without having to look at a computer screen.

This was my first major Python project. I made this during the 2020 pandemic when we had to copy a lot of notes sent online.

The program reads out the text so you can write it down rather than copying it from a screen. It has a few functoinalities like saving the audio file, importing test from other files etc.
